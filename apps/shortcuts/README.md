# App ClockInfo Shortcuts

An app that allows you to create custom ClockInfo shortcuts that launch a chosen app

## Create a Shortcut
If you haven't yet created a shortcut, when using a clock that supports clockinfo a custom clockinfo will appear with a ``+`` button that launches the app.

If you have existing shortcuts, launch the app to add and delete shortcuts

When adding a shortcut, first select the app you which to use, then select the icon you wish to register to the shortcut.

App icons can't be used as clockinfo icons must be 24x24 1bpp, but this app includes a number of useful icons that can be used instead.
